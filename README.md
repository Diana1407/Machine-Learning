# Machine-Learning

This is a project based on brain anomaly detection that classifies CT scans of the brain.

The task is to discriminate between two classes of brain CT scans, one that contains anomalies (label 1) and one that is normal (class 0). Each sample is a grayscale image of 224x224 pixels.

Each example is assigned to one of the two classes. The training set consists of 15,000 labeled examples. The validation set consists of 2,000 labeled examples. The test set consists of another 5,149 examples. The test labels are not provided with the data.

The documentation is explaining the approches I used in order to solve the problem.
